## About

Hi, I'm Grim, a self-taught software developer.
![TheGrimSilence](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/873786931/1564028115/1500x500)
I'm not a well-known package author, I just develop solutions for any problem I run in to. I created [Ebongarde](https://ebongarde.com) to be the home for my software projects but it fell short and was dissolved in 2017. Currently, I'm working to rebuild Ebongarde with a new suite of software projects.

I've written a few small projects like [xTouch](https://github.com/XplorationByAdrian/touch) and my new project [Strategos](https://github.com/TheGrimSilence/strategos). My day job has unfortunately taken up most of my time over the past year as well as some personal life issues, but I'm finally able to grind away at my keyboard again!

I mostly enjoy building projects for experience, but building out solutions to problems, and making other developer's lives easier is my passion. Whether it's making something cross-platform or rethinking how we deal with certain situations, I'm always happy to help. I don't even ask for a thank you. üòÇ

**Thank you for your time! üíÄüòÅ**

## Contact
